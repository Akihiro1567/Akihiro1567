My name is Aki. I am a teenage programmer. 
I am studying web development and game development as of now.
I am fluent in HTML, CSS, and JS, and I am learning React, C#, C++, PHP, SQL, and a couple others right now.
I want to work on smaller projects with smaller teams relating to web development or game development. I am a fast learner and work efficiently.
I primarily use discord for communication. Nothing else as of now.
